# What I've Developed:
Real-Time Weather Data: Our Weather Forecasting App provides you with up-to-the-minute weather information, including the current weather conditions. <br /> 

4-5 Hour Weather Forecast: Get a glimpse into the future with our app, which offers a 4-5 hour weather forecast, helping you plan ahead. <br />

Detailed Weather Insights: We don't just stop at temperature; our app also provides valuable insights such as humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. <br />

OpenWeatherMap Integration: We've harnessed the power of the OpenWeatherMap API to bring you real-time and forecasted weather data. And here's the best part â€“ OpenWeatherMap offers its services to developers at no cost. <br /> 

# How to Get Started:
Clone the Repository: Simply clone this repository to your local machine with a single command.<br /> 

API Key: To access real-time and forecasted weather data, you'll need an API key from OpenWeatherMap. Don't worry, it's absolutely free for developers! <br /> 

Run the App: Open the app's main file (e.g., index.html) in your web browser. Enter your desired location (city name) in the input field.<br /> 

Real-Time Weather: The app displays the current weather for your chosen location, giving you crucial details like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure. <br /> 

4-5 Hour Forecast: In addition to real-time data, we also provide a forecast for the next 4-5 hours, including forecasted temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure. <br /> 

Start Planning: Armed with this information, you can make informed decisions about your day based on current and future weather conditions. <br />
